### Notes on Kinetic Sculpture

From 2001 to 2003, I searched for information on the origins of interactive / cybernetic / robotic / living sculpture. I found a number of interesting sources published in the 1960s during an active period of kinetic and machine art, but after this short time, public work in kinetic sculpture seemed to mostly stop for about fifteen years. 

In the past decade, ideas and technical innovations within the robotics and electronics communities have opened up new possibilities for kinetic sculpture. A contemporary group of artists are creating work where the focus is not on the movement of the sculpture but on its behavior &mdash; how it reacts and actively responds to its dynamic environment.
  
These pages present raw notes from my exploration into this history. They are presented _as is_ and may contain grammatical and spelling errors due to quick typing.

#### Bibliography

The references presented below range from short articles to books representing years of research. Most references address the topic of kinetic sculpture, but there are a few references on automata, cybernetics, and robotics. I found the references with their numbers in italics to be the most useful.
