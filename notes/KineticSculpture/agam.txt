Agam, like Soto, has made work that is transformable when viewer passes in front of it

his art is based on the realm of the possible

[23, p110] 
quote from Agam
"Indeed, nothing is fixed in nature nor in the cosmos, and the painting that attempts to attain the truth through congealed/fixed representations falls far short of touching this truth of nature. Everything in nature/reality/creation can be transformed with endless variety, while preserving a particular and defined character"

movement allows for the presentation of the unfolding of a structure in time

1952 his work shifted, to engage the spectator to participate actively in the movement, some of the work requires physical manipulation and other only moving in front of the work

the viewer's presence produces motion

[10, p14] 
quote from Agam

"living expression of reality instead of fixing it forever, as did the art of all the great civilizations." 

"The artwork is an event in perpetual evolution. Reality must not be looked at as through a window that looks out on a landscape that never changes, even with the seasons, but as a permanent event in which one participates."

in his contrapuntal and polyphonic works, the structure is only revealed if a viewer moves in front of them
in his transformables, the elements may be rearranged freely by the spectator-participant
