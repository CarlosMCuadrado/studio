Marcel Duchamp
b1887 France

Bicycle Wheel, 1913
- the first modern work to contain actual movement to express meaning (Hulten)
Rotary Glass Plate (Precision Optics), w/Man Ray, 1920
Rotary Demisphere (Precision Optics), 192
Rotoreliefs (1935)

this work is more metaphysical and aesthetic than art in motion

[05] Guy Brett, Kinetic Art

Duchamp, Gabo, Moholy-Nagy machines are examples of the transformative process of movement
- Duchamps's machine revolves so that multiple planes create the appearance (illusion) of a single surface
- Gabo's appears to have volume (virtual volume)
- Moholy-Nagy's transforms from an object to an environmental experience

Rotary Glass Plate (Precision Optics). 1920

[14, p103]
quote from Man Ray
"a strange machine consisting of narrowpanels ofglass on which were traced parts of a spiral, mountedona ballbearing axis connected toamotor.Theidea was that when these panels were set in motion, revolving, they completed the spiral when looked at from the front."

the addition of a fourth dimension reduces space to a flat, intangible surface


Rotary Demisphere (Precision Optics). 1925

commissioned by Jacques Doucet

motor revolves a white demisphere painted with black eccentric circles. rotation makes it appear to recede in space rather than protrude.

enlisted the assistance of a technition, disk is covered in black velvet

wanted his work to be considered Optics and not included in art exhibitions

[07] Jack Burnam, Beyond Modern Sculpture

Rotating Glass Plates - five glass plates attached to a rod and turned by a small fan belt attached to an electric motor

Bicycle - at the time it was one of the most elegant and modern objects. ball-bearing mounted axel and tension-wire spokes
- a light turn would set it in motion for minutes
- wheel into optical device

he considered mechanical movement to be "unartistic", classified his work as not mechanical - thought the future of art would be created through the manipulation of light, through a technology more sophisticated than mechanics.

dematerialization

The Movement

Duchamp distanced himself from the art world

1935 created 12 rotoreliefs, placed them on the turntable of a phonograph, producing the illusion of motion in perspective, appear three-dimensional when set in motion

he made an experiment for showing his art directly to the people

he rented a tiny stand at Concours Lepine, near the Porte de Versailles
and people passed by without paying attention. all the disks were turning at once, placed horizontally and vertically

[23] Popper, Origins and Development of Kinetic art

had been studying motion and machines
The Bride, 1912
The Coffee Grinder, 1911 (image of the mechanism, not exterior)
Nude Descending Staircase, 1912
"applying machinism to being"

[23, p50]
quote from Duchamp
"This picture is not a painting, but an organization of kinetic elements - an expression of time and space through the abstract presentation of movement ... But we must bear in mind that, when we consider the movementofformin space over a certain time, we are entering the realm of geometry and mathematics, as when we construct a machine."

there is direct link between bicycle wheel to this other rotary work
