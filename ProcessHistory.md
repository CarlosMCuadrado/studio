####The History of the Process Works

The Process Series started in 2004 and it is ongoing. The first phase was concluded in 2010 with the Process Compendium exhibition and publication. The Process Compendium archives Process 4 - 18. Each Process work is a text that defines a visual system. The text is interpreted in code and is displayed as software. A Process text might have more than one software interpretation, e.g. _Process 18 (Software 1)_, _Process 18 (Software 2)_, etc. The complete set of Process texts created to date, as well as a general description of the metasystem is [linked here.](./ProcessCompendium.md) In addition to the complete list of texts, the Process work from 2004-2010 is archived as two editions of fifteen c-prints with one _key_ print with a full set of the texts. 

The Process series starts its numbering at 4 because of a series of texts titled Structure 1 - 3 that came before. This set of texts was completed as a part of the [_{Software} Structures_](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/) project, commissioned by the Whitney Museum's Artport in 2004. The _{Software} Structures_ essay, texts, and code opened the way to the Process series. The name was changed from "Structure" to "Process" to better describe the texts. 

The first public exhibition of works from the Process series was the _Process / Drawing_ show at the bitforms gallery from 4 March - 3 April 2005. This show debuted of Process 4, Process 5, and Process 6 as well as archival pigment prints related to the Processes and other works and collaborations. At this time, the Process works were installed with the instructions and software side by side. As shown in Figure 1, the instructions were printed as archival pigment prints and attached to the wall behind a thin sheets of plexiglass. The software was run on custom-built PCs without cases screwed to the wall near the floor. Monitors (17" LCD) were mounted at eye level with cables running between the PCs and the screens. When the same work was presented at the DAM Gallery in Berlin in the fall of 2005, the format had changed slightly. As shown in Figure 2, the software was running on Mac Mini machines with their covers removed instead of the custom-built PCs.

The _Process / Form_ show at the bitforms gallery from 6 March - 12 April 2008 was the first to present the Process works as single-channel dyptych projections. In this format, the Process _surface_ is presented side by side with the Process _diagram_. The surface is an interpretation of the Process text and the diagram MORE This show debuted Process 13 and Process 18. MORE discuss the panels and the vinyl or silkscreen text.

The Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami presented the final, and most refined, presentation of the single-channel Process dyptychs in the Abstract Cinema show from 26 March - 10 May 2009. Process 16 was presented in a black-box room using one of the same projectors from the bitforms exhibition.

The Field Conditions exhibition at the SFMOMA was the next evolution of the Process works. For this exhibition, Process 7 was re-imagined as a two-channel work for vertical 55" LED screens. The screens were bright (800 nits) and had 2mm wide frames to help the screen hardware to disappear. The most radical change for this installation was the decision to remove the Process and Element texts from the wall adjacent to the screens. In the context of the museum, where wall didactics are used for all works, this was the best way to convey the information. MORE

Part of this ten-year evolution is related to how technologies advanced, which is interelated to the budgets available for equipment to display the work. Another aspect was finding better ways to present the work through experience. The primary work, the text and the way the software was constructured from the text, was consistent throughout the seven years leading up the the Compendium and it remains the same today.
